##State of the Art

This is a reimplementation, in C, of the classic Amiga demo State Of The Art, by Spaceballs: http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=99

**Work in progress:** Only the first minute or so of the demo is complete. Contributions appreciated!

The code is new, but it uses the demo's original graphics, animation, and sounds.

To build it, you'll need SDL2 (and dev packages), mikmod, and Python 3.

cd native
make data
make
./sota
